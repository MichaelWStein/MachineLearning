# MachineLearning
Contains files related to machine learning.

There are two files related to classification with support of Machine Learning 
- ExoplanetVectorMachine for identification of exoplanets with the SVC, linear kernel (from sklearn)
- ... for identification of exoplanets with random tree (also from sklearn).

For the SVC model a GriSearch optimization was conducted.
